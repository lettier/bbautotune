	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

  abstract     = {Physics engines have been used in robotics research for a long time. Beside their traditional application as a  substitute for real world interactions due to their higher speed, safety and flexibility, they have recently also been used for motion planning and high level action planning. We propose to further explore the idea of using a physics engine as means to give a robot a basic physical understanding of its environment. In this paper, as a preliminary step, we study, how accurately the process
of pushing flat objects across a table with a robot arm can be predicted in a physics engine. We also present an approach to adapt the engines parameters to enhance the simulation accuracy.},
